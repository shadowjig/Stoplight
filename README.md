# Stoplight

This SmartApp takes a RGB bulb and makes it into a stoplight for children.  The idea is to give young children a sense of when they can get up/come out of their room in the morning.  Set the bulb to red at night while sleeping and set to green in the morning when appropriate to come out of their room.

This SmartApp will setup 2 sets of schedules.  One set is for weekdays and one for weekends.  Each set has a green start time and a red start time.  You can also set the level, hue, and saturation to your liking.  Level will be personal choice....but my hue is set to 0 for red and 33 for green.  And both saturations are set to 100 (giving the most color).
